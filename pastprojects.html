                    <p> Below is a video of a clone of space invaders that i was making for a game programming class at UNI it
                        is made in SDL and uses vectors for the drawing of the sprites. currently the collision is based
                        in circle to circle and it’s all ways checking for a collision, so it is not performance wise the
                        best idea in future I plan to refactor this code to allow it to be more optimal perhaps add in box2D
                        to check for collision. I will also be changing the vectors to object pools and add in some piratical
                        systems for when the bad guys explode. sound will be added using Fmod as well currently this is a
                        work and progress that is for a bit of fun.

                    <p> Below you see one of my projects that I was working on in computer graphics class at University. it is
                        written in Java using OpenGL2 framework it’s a submarine with a texture as well as a sand textured
                        ocean floor. the challenges I faced in this project were attaching the textures to the submarine
                        and ocean floor and enabling the Fog that you see. the fog color kept changing everything so that
                        the whole scene will be blue rather than its respective colors. after talking with people and lots
                        of stack overflow I found out that this was happening because I hadn’t added the texture matrix also
                        the third person camera with movement controls as you can move the camera around the submarine as
                        you can see whilst also being able to move it. everything is in a push pop matrix. I have included
                        me work log for this project in the downloads section of this portfolio or you can click the link

                    <p>
                        below is the first attempt at making the third person camera. in this video, it only moves around the x and z-axis with ++x
                        and ++z. it also has rotate enabled this was just to get the maths and the know-how in my head on
                        how to make the camera follow the submarine. This code would not really work for anything but looking
                        at how the submarine looks as the camera is looking as a static location and it will need to follow
                        the submarines movement though the world.

                <p> elow you see the solar system that I made in class using a template that the tutor gave us the planets are
                    all in their own entity sub derived from a planet class they all have their size, positions, and time
                    to rotate relative to the sun the sun being at 0,0,0. all the planets are in a push pop matrix with gl.gltranslate
                    moving them away and around the sun. my struggles with this were getting the first-person camera logic
                    in my head and all the trigonometry that goes along with it.

                        below is my first play with OpenGL where I made a planet with asteroids and atmosphere. my struggle with this was the particle
                        system that we made to spawn the asteroids as it needed to randomize the asteroids as they spawned
                        with a different amount of points and edges also the place in which the spawn and how high. One of
                        the main problems I had in this project was learning how to adapt trigonometry in to use in the opengl
                        world. I over came this by talking with the teacher and with help from my peers. The asteroids that
                        you see are set up with random sizes and random edges. I developed this code below to make them initialise
                        with those random values. Then draw them on the screen using a triangle fan. The next step was then
                        making them work with a particle system the difficulty I had with this task was making an array of
                        asteroids it only took a small talk with the teacher to get my head around it. I then used the INIT
                        on the particle system to INIT the asteroids to then draw. The draw calls the asteroids draw method
                        and the think of the particle system then goes though the array of asteroids and calls the asteroids
                        think.

                        Below is a link to a link list data structure that I made in our DSA class. this was an assignment that was given to us to
                        build a data structure and then test that structure with data and a load to see how it performs we
                        then had to right a report on our findings explain them which you can see below. I discovered that
                        a link list is not the best form of data structure especially for a lot of data to store. But in
                        smaller lists it performs adequately.

                        here is a link to my Data structures and algorithms course work. in this class we learned about j unit tests and how the
                        make sure, that the code we wrote is robust and does what it was intended to do. Before this class
                        I had not heard of test-driven development and how to keep the code that we had robust and working
                        the way that was intended. We also where told about binary trees red, black tress and ways of sorting
                        data. we also learned about optionals and how they work to make sure that the data being returned
                        was actually data and not a null value. You are welcome to look thought the lab work that I have
                        done. Thought this class I have a greater understanding of data stuctures. However, I still need
                        more practice in this area as I still cant make a red black tree.

                        here is the link to my first game that I made. it’s a text-based game made in java that loads in a text file it was an assignment
                        that we had to make as a class this was made as we were just learning java before OOP was taught.
                        One of the main features that I wanted to put In this code is the ability to modify the amount of
                        rooms in the map without hard coding the array size. After playing around for a few days asking people
                        and looking at the Java API to figure out how reading in a file worked I simply made a scan that
                        would read in the first line from the text file and it would make that the array size. This worked
                        for my purposes but looking back over it. It doesn’t check to see If the first line is a number or
                        not meaning that if some one was to play with the text file and place a letter in there it would
                        break the code. looking over this code I would change a few things perhaps making all the text in
                        the game load from file allowing me to edit the game just but editing the text file this will also
                        allow me to make more text based games and just one loader.

                        Here is my first log book that we needed to keep for my first class on Coding. we were coding in c and it was the first language
                        that I learned. until recently I didn’t think that creating log books would be useful I was wrong
                        and I have begun making more of them for each of my projects.

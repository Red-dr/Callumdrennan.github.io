            <p>This isÂ the game that i have been working on. I have called it Darknight. It uses Box2D for the in world physics,
            as well as Fmod for the sound and SDL for rendering.
            Around every sprite is a box that handles the collision between the objects. This is in the world of Box2D, which also controls
            the gravity and the movement of the sprites. The player sprite moves by using ApplyLinearImpulse(). 
            The enemies(the guys in red) have no AI and the collision between the player and the enemies do not register an event.
            Currently there is no player sprite moving right for attack, movment and jumping. The attack animation currently
            spawns a box2d body as a sensor right in front of the player. This then collides with every thing around it
            but only registers if the the box happens to collide with enemies. This is a work in progress and will be completed
            within the next few months.

              <p>
                  Before i begain the project i had never used the box2D framwork before. so there was a large learning curve to get this towork 
                  when i started with darwing sprite in the game the sprites would draw at there pixel coordanates there (x,y) on the screen.
                  as box2D used meters in the world we had to convert from pixels to meters. i developed this code below to convert my box2d code to work with piexel coordanates.
                  this code takes the positions of the b2vec2 (x,y) it then uses those coordanates to get the other coordanates for the sides of the box and mulitplys them by 
                  30 (PTM) to get the location of the of the Body in the box2d world and draw them in the correct place. 
                 
              </p>

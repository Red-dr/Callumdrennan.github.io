                <ul>

                    <p> below is a video of a clone of space invaders that i was making for a game prgraming class at UNI it
                        is made in SDL and uses vectors for the drawing of the sprites. currently the collision is based
                        in circle to circle and its all ways checcking for a colision so it is not performance wize the best
                        idea in future i plan to refactor this code to alow it be be more optimal perhaps add in box2D to
                        check for collision. i will also be chaning the vectors to opject pools and add in some partiacal
                        sytems for when the bad guys explode. sound will be added using Fmod aswell currentl this is a work
                        and progress that is for a bit of fun </p>

                    <p> Below you see one of my projects that I was working on in computer graphics class at University. it is
                        written in Java using OpenGL2 framework its a submarine with a texture as well as a sand textured
                        ocean floor. the challenges I faced in this project were attaching the textures to the submarine
                        and ocean floor and enabling the Fog that you see. the fog color kept changing everything so that
                        the whole scene will be blue rather than its respective colors. after talking with people and lots
                        of stack overflow i found out that this was happening becoude i hadent added the texture matrix also
                        the third person camera with movent controls as you can move the camera around the submarine as you
                        can see whilst also being able to move it. everything is in a push pop matrix. i have inclueded my
                        work log for this project in the downloads section of this portfolio or click here

                    <p>
                        below is the first attempt at making the third person camera. in this video, it only moves around the x and z-axis with ++x
                        and ++z. it also has rotate enabled this was just to get the maths and the know-how in my head on
                        how to make the camera fallow the submarine.

                <p> below you see the solar system that I made in class using a template that the tutor gave us the planets are
                    all in there own entity sub derived from a planet class they all have there size, positions, and time
                    to rotate relative to the sun the sun being at 0,0,0. all the planets are in a push pop matrix with gl.gltranslate
                    moving them away and around the sun. my struggles with this were getting the first person camera logic
                    in my head and all the trigonometry that goes along with it.</p>

                        below is my first play with OpenGL where I made a planet with asteroids and atmosphere. my struggle with this was the particle
                        system that we made to spawn the asteroids as it needed to randomize the asteroids as they spawned
                        with a differnt amount of points and edges also the place in which the spawn and how high. </p>

                        below is a link to a link list data stucture that i made in our DSA class. this was an assinment that was given to us to
                        build a data stucture and then test that stucture with data and a load to see how it performs we
                        then had to right a report on our findings explaing them which you can see below i discoverd that
                        a linklist is not the best form of data stucture espesaly for alot of data to store but in smaller
                        lists it performs adiqutly.

                        here is a link to my Data stuctures and algorithems course work. in this class i learnd about j unit tests and how the make
                        sure that the code we wrote is robust and does what it was entended to do. we learned about optionals
                        to make sure that the data being returned was actualy data and not a null value

                        here is the link to my first game that i made. its a text baced game made in java that loads in a text file it was an assinment
                        that we had to make as a class this was made as we where just learning java before OOP was taught.
                        looking over this code i would change a few things perhaps making all the text in the game load from
                        file alowing me to edit the game just but editing the text file this will also allow me to make more
                        text baced games and just one loader.

                        here is my first log book that we needed to keep for my first class on Coding. we where coding in c and it was the first
                        lanuage that i learned. untill resently i didnt think that creating log books would be usefull i
                        was wrong and i have begun making more of them for each of my projects.
